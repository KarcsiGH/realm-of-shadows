# REALM OF SHADOWS — Life Path Character Generation System
## Draft v1.0 — For Review & Revision

---

## OVERVIEW

Each character goes through **9 life events** across **3 phases**:
- **Childhood** (ages ~5-12): 2 events + 1 defining moment
- **Youth** (ages ~13-17): 2 events + 1 defining moment
- **Early Adulthood** (ages ~18-22): 2 events + 1 defining moment

Each event grants **stat adjustments**. Regular events give +1 to +2 points across stats. Defining moments give +2 to +3 and carry extra narrative weight.

After all 9 events, the player sees their stat totals and selects a class. The game highlights which classes their stats naturally favor.

**Base stats before life path:** Every stat starts at **5** (representing baseline human). Life path events build from there, typically ending with totals in the 8-18 range depending on choices, roughly matching the design doc starting stats.

**Quick Roll option:** Skip the life path entirely. Assigns the fixed starting stats from the design doc for the chosen class, plus a random +0 to +2 per stat.

---

## LIFE STREAMS (Pass 1)

Four primary streams with crossover points:

1. **Rural/Wilderness** — Farm life, nature, frontier survival
2. **Urban/Criminal** — City streets, crime, cunning
3. **Military** — Discipline, combat, duty
4. **Noble** — Privilege, education, politics

Characters begin by choosing an **Origin** (Childhood Event 1), which determines their starting stream. Later events can cross streams at marked **[CROSSOVER]** points.

---

## STAT BUDGET GUIDE

To land near the design doc starting stats (~52-66 total points across 6 stats), the life path should distribute roughly **45-55 stat points** on top of the base 30 (5 per stat).

- Regular events: ~3-4 total stat points each (spread across 1-3 stats)
- Defining moments: ~4-5 total stat points each
- Random seasoning at end: +0 to +1 per stat (0-6 bonus)
- Total from 6 regular events: ~18-24 points
- Total from 3 defining moments: ~12-15 points
- Random: ~0-6 points
- **Grand total added: ~30-45 points → Final stats ~60-75 total**

This gives slightly more total points than the design doc starters, which is intentional — life path characters should feel like they've *lived* and earned a slight edge over quick-roll characters.

---

## PHASE 1: CHILDHOOD (Ages 5-12)

### EVENT 1: ORIGIN (Where did you grow up?)

This is the stream-setting choice. Every character starts here.

---

#### ORIGIN A: A FARMING VILLAGE ON THE FRONTIER
**Stream: Rural/Wilderness**

*You grew up in a small village at the edge of the known lands. Days were spent hauling water, mending fences, and chasing goats through muddy fields. The work was hard, but the land was honest. At night, the elders told stories of what lurked beyond the treeline.*

**Stats: STR +1, CON +2, WIS +1**

→ Opens: Rural Childhood events

---

#### ORIGIN B: THE CROWDED STREETS OF A PORT CITY
**Stream: Urban/Criminal**

*You grew up in the tangled streets of Saltmere, where the air smelled of fish, tar, and opportunity. Every alley was a shortcut, every market stall a lesson in watching and waiting. You learned early that the quick eat and the slow go hungry.*

**Stats: DEX +2, INT +1, WIS +1**

→ Opens: Urban Childhood events

---

#### ORIGIN C: A GARRISON TOWN IN THE BORDERLANDS
**Stream: Military**

*You grew up in the shadow of fortress walls, where soldiers drilled at dawn and trumpets marked the hours. Your parents served the garrison — whether as soldiers, smiths, or cooks, the military rhythm shaped your days. You learned to stand straight before you learned to read.*

**Stats: STR +2, CON +1, PIE +1**

→ Opens: Military Childhood events

---

#### ORIGIN D: A NOBLE ESTATE IN THE HEARTLANDS
**Stream: Noble**

*You grew up behind high stone walls, surrounded by servants, tutors, and expectations. Your family's name carried weight — and burden. Meals were formal, lessons were strict, and every interaction was a small performance. You learned manners before you learned to play.*

**Stats: INT +2, PIE +1, WIS +1**

→ Opens: Noble Childhood events

---

### EVENT 2: CHILDHOOD EVENT (What shaped your early years?)

Options depend on Origin choice.

---

#### RURAL STREAM — Childhood Event 2

**R-C2a: YOU HELPED TEND THE ANIMALS AND FIELDS**
*From the moment you could carry a bucket, you worked. Feeding livestock before dawn, pulling weeds until your hands cracked, hauling harvest to the storehouse. It was grueling, but your body grew strong and your patience deep.*

**Stats: STR +1, CON +2**

→ Leads to: Rural childhood defining moments

**R-C2b: YOU WANDERED THE WOODS ALONE FOR HOURS**
*While other children played in the village square, you slipped into the forest. You learned which berries were safe, where the deer trails led, how to read weather in the leaves. The woods felt more like home than home did.*

**Stats: WIS +2, DEX +1**

→ Leads to: Rural childhood defining moments
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Also unlocks some Urban events in Youth (ran away)

**R-C2c: A STRANGER PASSED THROUGH AND TAUGHT YOU SOMETHING**
*A wandering traveler sheltered in your village for a season. They spoke of distant cities and strange ideas. They taught you letters, or card tricks, or a fighting stance — something that cracked open your small world.*

**Stats: INT +2, DEX +1**

→ Leads to: Rural childhood defining moments
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens some Noble/Military events in Youth (educated outsider)

---

#### URBAN STREAM — Childhood Event 2

**U-C2a: YOU RAN WITH A GANG OF STREET KIDS**
*There was safety in numbers and mischief in plenty. You learned to climb walls, squeeze through windows, and vanish into crowds. Loyalty was everything — betray the gang and you'd sleep alone.*

**Stats: DEX +2, STR +1**

→ Leads to: Urban childhood defining moments

**U-C2b: YOU WORKED IN A SHOP OR TAVERN**
*A merchant or innkeeper took you on — sweeping floors, carrying crates, serving customers. You learned to count coins, read people's faces, and keep your mouth shut when it mattered.*

**Stats: INT +1, WIS +1, PIE +1**

→ Leads to: Urban childhood defining moments
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens some Noble events in Youth (merchant connections)

**U-C2c: YOU BEGGED ON THE STREETS AND LEARNED TO SURVIVE**
*No one looked after you. You slept in doorways, ate what you could find or charm out of strangers, and learned that pity is a resource like any other. The world was brutal, but you were stubborn.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1**

→ Leads to: Urban childhood defining moments

---

#### MILITARY STREAM — Childhood Event 2

**M-C2a: YOU TRAINED WITH THE GARRISON CHILDREN**
*The soldiers let the children drill alongside them — wooden swords, formation marching, basic commands. Most kids treated it as a game. You took it seriously.*

**Stats: STR +2, CON +1**

→ Leads to: Military childhood defining moments

**M-C2b: YOU SPENT TIME IN THE GARRISON INFIRMARY**
*Whether from illness or curiosity, you ended up helping the healers. You learned to clean wounds, mix poultices, and sit with the dying. It changed how you saw the cost of war.*

**Stats: WIS +2, PIE +1**

→ Leads to: Military childhood defining moments
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Spiritual/Healer path in Youth

**M-C2c: YOU BEFRIENDED A VETERAN WHO TOLD YOU STORIES**
*An old soldier, scarred and half-blind, sat on the same bench every evening. You brought them food and they gave you stories — battles, betrayals, distant lands, hard truths about glory and death.*

**Stats: WIS +1, INT +1, CON +1**

→ Leads to: Military childhood defining moments

---

#### NOBLE STREAM — Childhood Event 2

**N-C2a: YOU EXCELLED AT YOUR STUDIES**
*Languages, history, mathematics, natural philosophy — your tutors praised your sharp mind. Your family expected nothing less, but privately, you enjoyed the learning for its own sake.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1**

→ Leads to: Noble childhood defining moments

**N-C2b: YOU TRAINED WITH THE HOUSE GUARD**
*Against your family's wishes — or perhaps at their insistence — you spent afternoons in the training yard. The master-at-arms didn't care about your bloodline, only whether you could hold a blade properly.*

**Stats: STR +2, DEX +1**

→ Leads to: Noble childhood defining moments
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Military events in Youth

**N-C2c: YOU SNUCK OUT TO PLAY WITH THE COMMON CHILDREN**
*The estate was suffocating. You climbed the garden wall and found a different world — rougher, louder, more alive. You learned to hide your accent, throw a punch, and keep secrets from your parents.*

**Stats: DEX +2, CON +1**

→ Leads to: Noble childhood defining moments
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Urban events in Youth

---

### EVENT 3: CHILDHOOD DEFINING MOMENT

Options depend on both Origin AND Childhood Event 2.

These carry more narrative weight and larger stat bonuses.

---

#### RURAL DEFINING MOMENTS

**R-DM1: THE FOREST FIRE**
*A wildfire swept through the valley. While adults panicked, you helped herd animals to safety, carried water, and guided younger children to the river. When it was over, the village elder said you had the heart of a protector.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1, STR +1** (4 total)

**R-DM2: FOUND BY THE FAE**
*You wandered too deep into the woods one twilight and stumbled into a ring of pale mushrooms. Strange lights danced. Voices whispered things you almost understood. You were returned to the village edge at dawn with no memory of the night — but something had changed inside you.*

**Stats: WIS +2, PIE +2** (4 total)
*Note: Slightly mystical — favors Monk, Cleric, Ranger paths*

**R-DM3: THE WOLF ATTACK**
*A pack of wolves came down from the mountains in a hard winter. They killed livestock and circled the village at night. When one cornered you behind the barn, you fought it off with a pitchfork. You still have the scar.*

**Stats: STR +2, CON +1, DEX +1** (4 total)
*Random element: Roll → Success (stats as above) OR Injury (CON +3, STR +1, but start with a "scarred" trait)*

---

#### URBAN DEFINING MOMENTS

**U-DM1: CAUGHT STEALING — AND SHOWN MERCY**
*You lifted a purse from the wrong person — a retired adventurer who caught your wrist like a vice. But instead of turning you in, they bought you a meal and told you there were better uses for quick hands. You never forgot it.*

**Stats: DEX +1, WIS +2, PIE +1** (4 total)

**U-DM2: WITNESSED SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE**
*Down a midnight alley, you saw something terrible — a murder, a dark ritual, a deal between people who wear respectable faces by day. You ran. You hid. You never told anyone. But you've been watching more carefully ever since.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1, DEX +1** (4 total)

**U-DM3: SAVED BY A STRANGER**
*You were cornered — by older kids, by a merchant you'd robbed, by something worse. A stranger intervened, someone powerful and strange. They said nothing, handled the situation, and vanished. You've been trying to be worthy of that rescue ever since.*

**Stats: PIE +2, CON +1, STR +1** (4 total)

---

#### MILITARY DEFINING MOMENTS

**M-DM1: THE BORDER RAID**
*Raiders struck the garrison at night. In the chaos, you grabbed a real sword for the first time. You didn't fight well — you were terrified — but you stood your ground when others ran. The commander noticed.*

**Stats: STR +1, CON +2, PIE +1** (4 total)

**M-DM2: A FRIEND WAS KILLED**
*Another garrison child, your closest friend, was killed in the raid — or by an accident during training, or by illness that the healers couldn't stop. You learned what loss means before you were old enough to understand it.*

**Stats: WIS +2, CON +1, PIE +1** (4 total)

**M-DM3: YOU FOUND A HIDDEN PASSAGE**
*Exploring the old fortress, you discovered a sealed room behind a crumbling wall. Inside: old weapons, strange books, a map to somewhere. You told the commander — or you kept it secret.*

**Stats: INT +2, DEX +1, WIS +1** (4 total)
*Random element: Told someone (PIE +1 bonus) vs. Kept secret (DEX +1 bonus)*

---

#### NOBLE DEFINING MOMENTS

**N-DM1: YOUR FAMILY WAS BETRAYED**
*A rival house moved against your family — politically, financially, or with steel in the night. You saw your parents humbled, your home threatened. It taught you that power is fragile and enemies are patient.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1, CON +1** (4 total)

**N-DM2: YOU STOOD UP TO YOUR PARENTS**
*There was a moment — a punishment you refused to accept, a cruelty to a servant you wouldn't allow, a path they chose for you that you rejected. You defied them and accepted the consequences. It was the first time you felt like yourself.*

**Stats: PIE +2, STR +1, WIS +1** (4 total)

**N-DM3: A SERVANT TAUGHT YOU THE REAL WORLD**
*Your nursemaid, your stable hand, a kitchen cook — someone beneath your family's notice became the most important person in your life. They taught you things no tutor would: how common people live, what hunger feels like, why walls exist from both sides.*

**Stats: WIS +2, CON +1, PIE +1** (4 total)

---

## PHASE 2: YOUTH (Ages 13-17)

### EVENT 4: YOUTH EVENT 1

Available options depend on your stream AND any crossovers unlocked. Characters who stayed in their stream get stream-specific options. Characters who unlocked crossovers see additional choices from other streams.

---

#### RURAL STREAM — Youth Event 1

**R-Y1a: APPRENTICED TO A LOCAL TRADE**
*The blacksmith, the carpenter, the herbalist — someone in the village took you on as an apprentice. The work was specific and demanding, but you developed real skill.*

**Stats: STR +1, INT +1, CON +1**

**R-Y1b: BECAME A HUNTER AND TRACKER**
*With the older hunters, you ranged further from the village than you'd ever been. You learned to read tracks, set snares, move silently through undergrowth, and kill cleanly.*

**Stats: DEX +2, WIS +1**

**R-Y1c: THE VILLAGE WAS ATTACKED**
*Bandits, or raiders, or something worse came to your village. Whether you fought, hid, or ran, nothing was the same afterward. Some people were taken. Some didn't come back.*

**Stats: CON +1, STR +1, WIS +1**
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Military Youth options (joined militia/guard)
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Urban Youth options (village destroyed, fled to city)

---

#### URBAN STREAM — Youth Event 1

**U-Y1a: WORKED FOR A FENCE OR SMUGGLER**
*You graduated from petty theft to real criminal enterprise. A fence taught you the value of goods, how to move stolen merchandise, and — most importantly — who not to cross.*

**Stats: INT +2, DEX +1**

**U-Y1b: JOINED A THIEVES' GUILD AS AN APPRENTICE**
*The guild found you — or you found them. Either way, you were tested, accepted, and trained. Lockpicking, pickpocketing, surveillance, escape routes. Professional crime.*

**Stats: DEX +2, INT +1**

**U-Y1c: TRIED TO GO STRAIGHT — WORKED AN HONEST JOB**
*You got tired of looking over your shoulder. A merchant, a shipwright, a baker — someone gave you honest work. The pay was worse but the sleep was better.*

**Stats: CON +1, PIE +1, STR +1**
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens some Military/Noble paths (respectable connections)

---

#### MILITARY STREAM — Youth Event 1

**M-Y1a: FORMALLY ENLISTED AS A CADET**
*Old enough now to join properly, you entered training. Real weapons, real formations, real consequences for failure. The drill instructors didn't care about your childhood; they cared about what you could become.*

**Stats: STR +2, CON +1**

**M-Y1b: ASSIGNED TO SCOUT DUTY ON THE BORDER**
*They needed young eyes and quick legs on the frontier patrols. You spent weeks in the wilderness between forts, watching for threats, living off the land, reporting what you found.*

**Stats: DEX +1, WIS +2**
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Rural stream connections

**M-Y1c: SERVED IN THE QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE**
*Not every soldier fights. You learned logistics, supply chains, record keeping, and the art of making things work behind the scenes. It was unglamorous but you understood how armies actually function.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1**

---

#### NOBLE STREAM — Youth Event 1

**N-Y1a: SENT TO COURT AS A PAGE**
*Your family sent you to serve a higher-ranking noble. You carried messages, observed politics, learned etiquette, and discovered that smiles could be weapons sharper than swords.*

**Stats: INT +1, PIE +2**

**N-Y1b: SENT TO A MILITARY ACADEMY**
*Your family wanted you hardened. The academy was cold, strict, and competitive. Nobility meant nothing there — only performance. You learned to fight, to lead, and to endure.*

**Stats: STR +2, CON +1**
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Military stream in adulthood

**N-Y1c: RAN AWAY FROM HOME**
*You couldn't take it anymore — the expectations, the politics, the gilded cage. You fled with nothing but the clothes on your back. For the first time, you were nobody. It was terrifying and exhilarating.*

**Stats: DEX +1, CON +1, WIS +1**
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Urban and Rural streams fully

---

### EVENT 5: YOUTH EVENT 2

Continues branching based on previous choices.

---

#### RURAL STREAM — Youth Event 2

**R-Y2a: TRAVELED TO A NEARBY TOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME**
*The village sent you to trade, or you went on your own. The town was overwhelming — so many people, so much noise, so many things you'd never seen. You came back changed, restless.*

**Stats: INT +1, WIS +1**
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Urban adulthood options

**R-Y2b: A HERMIT IN THE HILLS TOOK YOU AS A STUDENT**
*Deep in the hills, a recluse — a former monk, a hedge wizard, an old druid — agreed to teach you. The lessons were strange: meditation, herb lore, reading the wind. Half of it made no sense. Years later, all of it would.*

**Stats: WIS +2, PIE +1**

**R-Y2c: YOU HELPED DEFEND THE VILLAGE (MILITIA)**
*After the attack — or in preparation for the next one — you joined the village militia. Farmers with spears, but you drilled seriously. An old soldier who'd retired to the village taught you what he knew.*

**Stats: STR +1, CON +1, DEX +1**
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Military adulthood options

---

#### URBAN STREAM — Youth Event 2

**U-Y2a: YOU WENT TO SEA AS A CABIN BOY/GIRL**
*The docks were always calling. A captain needed young hands. The ship was filthy, the crew was rough, and the sea was merciless — but you saw places you'd only heard of in drunken sailors' tales.*

**Stats: CON +2, DEX +1**
→ Opens: Sea-flavored adulthood events

**U-Y2b: YOU GOT CAUGHT AND DID TIME**
*The law caught up. Months in a cell, or a work camp, or indentured to a merchant as punishment. It was miserable, but you survived it and came out harder, warier, and more determined.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1**
*Random element: Roll → Hardened (STR +1 bonus) vs. Embittered (INT +1 bonus)*

**U-Y2c: YOU FOUND A MENTOR IN THE UNDERWORLD**
*A master thief, a con artist, an information broker — someone experienced took an interest in you. Their lessons went beyond technique into strategy, patience, and knowing when to walk away.*

**Stats: INT +1, DEX +1, WIS +1**

---

#### MILITARY STREAM — Youth Event 2

**M-Y2a: SURVIVED YOUR FIRST REAL BATTLE**
*Not a raid, not a skirmish — a proper engagement with banners and shield walls and screaming. You saw people die. You didn't run. Afterward, your hands wouldn't stop shaking for a week.*

**Stats: CON +2, STR +1**
*Random element: Roll → Unshaken (STR +1 bonus) vs. Haunted (WIS +1 bonus)*

**M-Y2b: TRAINED UNDER A WEAPON MASTER**
*A renowned instructor selected you for advanced training. Weeks of brutal drills, technique refinement, and sparring against opponents who were always better than you. Until they weren't.*

**Stats: STR +1, DEX +2**

**M-Y2c: ASSIGNED TO PROTECT A DIPLOMAT**
*Escort duty. Boring, you thought — until the ambush, the poisoning attempt, or the tense negotiations where the wrong word meant war. You learned that fighting isn't always about swords.*

**Stats: INT +1, WIS +1, PIE +1**
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Opens Noble adulthood options (political connections)

---

#### NOBLE STREAM — Youth Event 2

**N-Y2a: ENTANGLED IN A POLITICAL SCHEME**
*Your family — or their rivals — drew you into an intrigue. Forged letters, secret meetings, alliances brokered in shadowed gardens. You learned that information is power and trust is a liability.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1**

**N-Y2b: FELL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE INAPPROPRIATE**
*A servant, a rival's child, a commoner, a foreigner — someone your family would never accept. Whether it lasted or ended in heartbreak, it cracked open your understanding of the world beyond your walls.*

**Stats: PIE +1, WIS +2**

**N-Y2c: DISCOVERED A FAMILY SECRET**
*In your father's study, your mother's locked chest, or a whispered conversation you weren't meant to hear — you learned something about your family that changed everything. A hidden debt, a crime, a forbidden allegiance, a sibling you never knew about.*

**Stats: INT +1, WIS +1, DEX +1**
*Random element: Roll → Confronted family (PIE +1 bonus) vs. Used the knowledge (INT +1 bonus)*

---

### EVENT 6: YOUTH DEFINING MOMENT

Major turning point. Larger stat bonuses.

---

#### RURAL DEFINING MOMENTS (Youth)

**R-YDM1: LEFT THE VILLAGE FOR GOOD**
*Something called you away — wanderlust, a burned home, a promise to someone lost. You packed what little you had and walked down the road without looking back. The village was behind you now. Everything else was ahead.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1, DEX +1** (4 total)

**R-YDM2: MADE A VOW AT A SACRED PLACE**
*Deep in the woods, at an ancient stone circle or a forgotten shrine, you knelt and swore an oath. To protect the land. To find what was lost. To become something more. The wind answered, or maybe it was just the wind.*

**Stats: PIE +2, WIS +2** (4 total)

**R-YDM3: TRACKED AND KILLED A DANGEROUS BEAST**
*Something was preying on the village — a great wolf, a monstrous boar, something with too many eyes. You tracked it for three days and two nights. When you came back, bloody and exhausted, you carried its head. The village celebrated. You just felt tired.*

**Stats: STR +2, DEX +1, WIS +1** (4 total)

---

#### URBAN DEFINING MOMENTS (Youth)

**U-YDM1: PULLED OFF A LEGENDARY HEIST**
*The job of a lifetime — a merchant's vault, a noble's treasury, a ship's cargo hold. The planning took weeks. The execution took minutes. When it was done, you had more gold than you'd ever seen — and a reputation that would follow you forever.*

**Stats: DEX +2, INT +2** (4 total)

**U-YDM2: BETRAYED BY SOMEONE YOU TRUSTED**
*Your partner, your mentor, your closest friend — they sold you out. For money, for safety, for reasons you'll never understand. You survived, but something in you calcified. Trust became a currency you spend very carefully.*

**Stats: WIS +2, INT +1, CON +1** (4 total)

**U-YDM3: CHOSE TO HELP SOMEONE AT GREAT COST TO YOURSELF**
*You could have walked away. Should have, probably. But someone was in trouble — a child, a debtor about to lose everything, a stranger targeted by the guild — and you stepped in. It cost you dearly. You'd do it again.*

**Stats: PIE +2, STR +1, WIS +1** (4 total)

---

#### MILITARY DEFINING MOMENTS (Youth)

**M-YDM1: HELD A POSITION AGAINST IMPOSSIBLE ODDS**
*Your unit was overrun, your commander was down, and retreat was the smart move. You didn't retreat. Somehow — stubbornness, terror, something deeper — you held. When reinforcements arrived, you were still standing.*

**Stats: CON +2, STR +1, PIE +1** (4 total)

**M-YDM2: DISOBEYED AN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES**
*The command was clear and the command was wrong. Civilians would have died, or prisoners would have been executed, or the retreat would have been a slaughter. You disobeyed. There were consequences. You'd accept them again.*

**Stats: PIE +2, WIS +1, STR +1** (4 total)

**M-YDM3: EARNED A BATTLEFIELD PROMOTION**
*In the chaos, when leadership faltered, you stepped forward. You rallied others, made a decision, gave an order — and it worked. People followed you because in that moment, you were the one who knew what to do.*

**Stats: STR +1, INT +1, PIE +1, WIS +1** (4 total)

---

#### NOBLE DEFINING MOMENTS (Youth)

**N-YDM1: PUBLICLY SHAMED YOUR FAMILY'S ENEMIES**
*At a feast, a tournament, a court proceeding — you outmaneuvered a rival family so cleanly that everyone saw it. Your parents were proud. Your enemies took note. You learned the taste of public victory.*

**Stats: INT +2, PIE +1, DEX +1** (4 total)

**N-YDM2: RENOUNCED YOUR TITLE**
*You walked away from everything — the name, the wealth, the expectations. Maybe in anger, maybe in principle, maybe because you wanted to know who you were without it. The world outside the walls was colder and harder than you imagined.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1, STR +1** (4 total)
→ **[CROSSOVER]** Fully opens all streams for adulthood

**N-YDM3: SURVIVED AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT**
*Poison in your wine, a blade in the dark, a "hunting accident" — someone wanted you dead. You survived through luck, instinct, or the sacrifice of someone loyal. Nothing felt safe afterward.*

**Stats: DEX +2, CON +1, WIS +1** (4 total)

---

## PHASE 3: EARLY ADULTHOOD (Ages 18-22)

### EVENT 7: EARLY ADULT EVENT 1

By now, the character's path is taking definite shape. Options reflect the culmination of earlier choices.

---

#### RURAL/WILDERNESS STREAM — Early Adult Event 1

**R-A1a: JOINED THE FRONTIER GUARD**
*The borderlands needed wardens. You signed on — long patrols through empty country, watching for threats that might never come, or might come tonight. The solitude suited you.*

**Stats: CON +1, WIS +1, STR +1**

**R-A1b: BECAME A TRAVELING HERBALIST/HEALER**
*Your knowledge of plants and remedies earned you a welcome in every village. You wandered from settlement to settlement, trading cures for meals and shelter. People began to seek you out.*

**Stats: WIS +2, PIE +1**

**R-A1c: SET OUT AS A WILDERNESS GUIDE**
*Merchants, pilgrims, and fools needed someone who knew the wild roads. You hired out your skills — navigation, survival, protection. Every journey was different. Some clients didn't make it.*

**Stats: DEX +1, WIS +1, INT +1**

---

#### URBAN/CRIMINAL STREAM — Early Adult Event 1

**U-A1a: JOINED A THIEVES' GUILD OFFICIALLY**
*No more freelancing. You took the oaths, learned the signs, and gained access to the network — jobs, fences, safe houses, information. The guild took a cut, but the work was steadier and the protection was real.*

**Stats: DEX +2, INT +1**

**U-A1b: WENT TO SEA WITH A PRIVATEER CREW**
*Not quite pirates, not quite navy — letters of marque made it legal, barely. The ship was fast, the captain was clever, and the prizes were rich. You learned to fight on a rolling deck and navigate by the stars.*

**Stats: DEX +1, CON +1, STR +1**

**U-A1c: ROBBED A BANK**
*The big score. Weeks of planning, a team of specialists, one night of execution. Everything depended on timing, nerve, and a little luck.*

**Stats:** *Random element: Roll →*
- *Success: DEX +2, INT +1 (plus bonus gold at game start)*
- *Caught: CON +2, WIS +1 (spent time locked up, came out wiser)*

---

#### MILITARY STREAM — Early Adult Event 1

**M-A1a: JOINED A PROFESSIONAL ARMY**
*Not a militia, not a garrison — a proper fighting force. You marched, you drilled, you waited, and eventually you fought. The army was your family now, for better and worse.*

**Stats: STR +1, CON +2**

**M-A1b: TRAINED AS A MILITARY SCOUT/RANGER**
*They needed sharp eyes more than strong arms. You learned to move unseen, survive alone, and bring back intelligence that saved lives. The work was lonely but essential.*

**Stats: DEX +2, WIS +1**
→ Connects with Rural/Wilderness themes

**M-A1c: JOINED THE NAVY AS A MIDSHIPMAN**
*The sea called, or the army didn't want you, or you wanted something different. Naval discipline was its own world — tighter quarters, harsher rules, and nowhere to desert to.*

**Stats: INT +1, CON +1, DEX +1**

---

#### NOBLE STREAM — Early Adult Event 1

**N-A1a: ENROLLED IN THE ACADEMY OF ARCANE ARTS**
*Your family's wealth opened doors that talent alone couldn't. The academy was rigorous — theory, practice, and the very real danger of magic gone wrong. Not every student graduated. Not every student survived.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1**

**N-A1b: TOOK OVER MANAGEMENT OF FAMILY LANDS**
*Whether by death, disgrace, or duty, the estate fell to you. Suddenly you were responsible for hundreds of people — tenants, servants, soldiers. The ledgers alone were overwhelming.*

**Stats: INT +1, WIS +1, PIE +1**

**N-A1c: DEDICATED YOURSELF TO A HOLY ORDER**
*Faith called — or politics demanded it — and you entered a religious order. The transition from silk to simple robes was jarring. The prayers, the fasting, the service to others... some of it felt like punishment. Some of it felt like freedom.*

**Stats: PIE +2, WIS +1**

---

### EVENT 8: EARLY ADULT EVENT 2

The penultimate event. Stakes are higher.

---

#### RURAL/WILDERNESS STREAM — Early Adult Event 2

**R-A2a: DISCOVERED ANCIENT RUINS IN THE WILDERNESS**
*Deep in uncharted territory, you found something old — crumbling walls covered in symbols, a sealed door, the remains of something that shouldn't exist this far from civilization. You explored as far as you dared.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1**

**R-A2b: SURVIVED A BRUTAL WINTER ALONE**
*Cut off by storms, injured, or simply lost — you spent weeks alone in the wild with dwindling supplies. You ate things you'd rather forget. You talked to yourself. But spring came, and so did you.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1**

**R-A2c: EARNED THE RESPECT OF A FRONTIER COMMUNITY**
*Through deeds, not words — a rescue, a defense, a problem solved — you became someone people trusted. They came to you for advice, for protection, for leadership you never asked for.*

**Stats: PIE +1, STR +1, WIS +1**

---

#### URBAN/CRIMINAL STREAM — Early Adult Event 2

**U-A2a: BUILT A NETWORK OF INFORMANTS**
*You realized information was worth more than gold. Slowly, carefully, you cultivated sources — beggars, servants, merchants, guards. A whisper network with you at its center.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1**

**U-A2b: NARROWLY ESCAPED A DEADLY RIVAL**
*Someone wanted your territory, your reputation, or your life. The confrontation came close — too close. You survived through speed, cunning, and a willingness to do what they didn't expect.*

**Stats: DEX +2, CON +1**

**U-A2c: FELL IN WITH A REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT**
*Not just crime for profit — crime for a cause. The group wanted to change things: overthrow a corrupt official, free imprisoned dissidents, redistribute hoarded wealth. The idealism was infectious. The danger was real.*

**Stats: PIE +1, INT +1, STR +1**

---

#### MILITARY STREAM — Early Adult Event 2

**M-A2a: LED A SQUAD IN A DANGEROUS MISSION**
*Behind enemy lines, into hostile territory, or through monster-infested ruins — your unit was given a job no one else wanted. You brought most of them back.*

**Stats: STR +1, INT +1, PIE +1**

**M-A2b: WOUNDED IN BATTLE AND RECOVERED**
*Steel or magic or claws — something put you down hard. The recovery was long and humbling. Healers patched your body; you had to rebuild your confidence yourself.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1**

**M-A2c: UNCOVERED CORRUPTION IN THE RANKS**
*An officer selling supplies, a commander betraying positions, bribes flowing from enemy coffers. You found the proof. What you did with it defined you.*

**Stats: INT +1, WIS +1, PIE +1**
*Random element: Roll → Reported it (PIE +1 bonus) vs. Used it as leverage (INT +1 bonus)*

---

#### NOBLE STREAM — Early Adult Event 2

**N-A2a: NEGOTIATED A CRITICAL ALLIANCE**
*Your family needed friends, and you were sent to broker the deal. Weeks of negotiation, veiled threats, calculated generosity, and finally — an agreement that changed the balance of power.*

**Stats: INT +1, WIS +1, PIE +1**

**N-A2b: FOUGHT A DUEL OF HONOR**
*Someone insulted your family, your honor, or your principles. Steel was drawn. The duel was formal, witnessed, and very real. Win or lose, you proved you'd stand behind your words.*

**Stats: STR +1, DEX +2**
*Random element: Roll → Won (STR +1 bonus) vs. Lost honorably (PIE +1 bonus)*

**N-A2c: WENT ON A PILGRIMAGE**
*For penance, for seeking, or for escape — you left everything behind and walked the ancient pilgrim roads. Months of simple living, quiet reflection, and encounters with strangers who owed you nothing and expected nothing.*

**Stats: WIS +2, PIE +1**

### EVENT 9: EARLY ADULT DEFINING MOMENT

The final event. This is the moment just before the game begins — the event that launches the character into adventure.

---

#### RURAL/WILDERNESS DEFINING MOMENTS (Early Adult)

**R-ADM1: SOMETHING DARK STIRRED IN THE WILDERNESS**
*The animals fled. The rivers ran strange. At night, the darkness felt... thicker. Something is wrong in the wild places, and you're one of the few who can feel it. You gathered your gear and headed toward the source, not away from it.*

**Stats: WIS +2, CON +1, STR +1** (4 total)

**R-ADM2: YOU RECEIVED A DESPERATE PLEA FOR HELP**
*A message — from your old village, from a friend in trouble, from a stranger who somehow knew your name. They need you. The journey will be dangerous. You went anyway.*

**Stats: PIE +2, STR +1, CON +1** (4 total)

**R-ADM3: YOU FOUND A MAP TO SOMETHING LEGENDARY**
*In the ruins, in a dead traveler's pack, in the pages of a crumbling book — a map. It points to something that shouldn't exist: a lost city, a forgotten weapon, a truth someone buried long ago. You couldn't leave it alone.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1, DEX +1** (4 total)

---

#### URBAN/CRIMINAL DEFINING MOMENTS (Early Adult)

**U-ADM1: THE GUILD GAVE YOU AN IMPOSSIBLE JOB**
*The target is heavily guarded, the deadline is impossible, and failure means death — yours. But the reward would set you up for life. You said yes before you thought it through.*

**Stats: DEX +2, INT +1, CON +1** (4 total)

**U-ADM2: YOU CHOSE TO LEAVE THE CRIMINAL LIFE**
*Enough blood, enough fear, enough looking over your shoulder. You walked away from everything — the connections, the money, the identity. Starting over with nothing but your skills and your scars.*

**Stats: WIS +2, PIE +1, CON +1** (4 total)

**U-ADM3: A DYING PERSON GAVE YOU A SECRET**
*In an alley, in a tavern back room, in a prison cell — someone with their last breath told you something that could shake kingdoms. A name, a location, a truth. They made you promise to act on it.*

**Stats: INT +2, WIS +1, PIE +1** (4 total)

---

#### MILITARY DEFINING MOMENTS (Early Adult)

**M-ADM1: YOUR UNIT WAS DESTROYED — YOU SURVIVED**
*Ambush, betrayal, overwhelming force — your company was shattered. You crawled out of the wreckage, the only survivor or one of a handful. The army considers you dead. You're not sure they're wrong.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1, STR +1** (4 total)

**M-ADM2: YOU WERE GIVEN A SPECIAL MISSION**
*High command selected you personally. The mission is classified, dangerous, and vital. You were given supplies, a destination, and orders to trust no one. Whatever happens next, you're on your own.*

**Stats: STR +1, INT +1, DEX +1, WIS +1** (4 total)

**M-ADM3: YOU DESERTED FOR A REASON YOU WON'T DISCUSS**
*You broke your oath. The penalty is death. Whatever you saw, whatever was ordered, whatever you learned — it was enough to make you throw away everything you'd built. You don't talk about why.*

**Stats: DEX +1, WIS +2, CON +1** (4 total)

---

#### NOBLE DEFINING MOMENTS (Early Adult)

**N-ADM1: YOUR FAMILY WAS DESTROYED**
*Fire, political purge, assassination, bankruptcy — it doesn't matter how. Everything is gone. The name that once opened doors now closes them. You have your education, your training, your wits, and nothing else.*

**Stats: CON +2, WIS +1, INT +1** (4 total)

**N-ADM2: YOU RECEIVED A VISION OR PROPHECY**
*In the temple, in a dream, from a dying seer — you were told something impossible about your destiny. You don't entirely believe it. But you can't stop thinking about it, and it's pulling you toward something.*

**Stats: WIS +2, PIE +1, INT +1** (4 total)

**N-ADM3: YOU UNCOVERED AN ANCIENT FAMILY LEGACY**
*In the family vault, in a sealed letter from a dead ancestor, in the ruins beneath your estate — evidence that your bloodline is connected to something ancient and powerful. And dangerous. And unfinished.*

**Stats: INT +2, PIE +1, WIS +1** (4 total)

## POST-LIFE-PATH: CLASS SELECTION

After completing all 9 events, the character sees:

1. **Their complete backstory** as a short narrative paragraph compiled from their choices
2. **Their final stat totals** (base 5 + all event bonuses + random seasoning of +0 to +1 per stat)
3. **Class recommendations** — the game highlights which classes their stats best support, sorted by fit:
   - "Natural fit" = meets or exceeds starting stats for that class
   - "Good fit" = close to starting stats
   - "Unusual choice" = stats don't align, but player can still choose it (underdog build)
4. **The player picks any class they want** regardless of recommendation

---

## QUICK ROLL OPTION

Available at the very start of character creation:

*"Every adventurer has a story. Would you like to discover yours?"*

- **[Tell My Story]** → Enters the life path system
- **[Quick Roll]** → Skip to class selection with fixed starting stats + random +0 to +2 per stat

---

## CROSSOVER SUMMARY TABLE

| Origin | Default Stream | Possible Crossovers |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Farming Village | Rural | → Urban (village attacked/fled), Military (joined militia) |
| Port City | Urban | → Noble (merchant connections), Military (navy/guard) |
| Garrison Town | Military | → Rural (border scout), Noble (diplomatic service) |
| Noble Estate | Noble | → Military (academy), Urban (ran away), Rural (renounced title) |

Crossovers typically open in Phase 2 (Youth) based on specific Phase 1 choices, allowing the character to blend streams for a more unique history.

---

## NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

- Each event should display with atmospheric narrative text and clear (but not explicitly numerical) hints about what stats are affected
- The mystery approach: Don't show "+2 STR" — instead describe the *feeling*. "Your arms ache from the work, but you've never felt stronger." Players discover their stats at the end.
- Events with random elements should show the outcome: "You fought the wolf... *and won*" or "You fought the wolf... *and barely survived*"
- The compiled backstory at the end should read as a coherent paragraph, not a list of choices
- Total event count per character: 9 choices across ~12-15 options per event = significant variety
- With 4 origin streams × branching × random elements, replay value is very high
- For a 6-character party, players will naturally want to try different streams for each character
